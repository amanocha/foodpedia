## What it does
FOODpedia uses a database of food types to decide different food options in the form of meal plans for users to follow and eat. Users enter in their information (age, height, weight, activity level etc.) and FOODpedia generates eight meal plans that users can follow based on their physical statistics. Each food presented in a meal plan assumes one serving of each food, and no caloric counts are viewable by users. Instead, FOODpedia calculates the amount of calories in each meal plan behind the scenes to make sure that the total caloric count is within the range of a healthy amount of food the user should be eating based on the physical statistics. The meal plan will also be composed of food that covers the necessary amounts of each nutrient the user requires.

Users can customize their meal plans by filtering out certain foods they have an allergy to and/or dislike eating. Based on the profile information, FOODpedia will decide which nutrients the user needs more, and thus change meal plans to prioritize certain nutrients.

Another feature FOODpedia uses to help users improve their relationships with food is the journal feature. In this feature, users can input in a food they have eaten, how they felt about eating the food, and additional notes. The emotions over the food are expressed in emoticons users can choose - these emoticons will have no words attached to them, so users can track their feelings on the food based on their own interpretations of the emoticons. Users can also view past entries through the calendar features so they can see patterns in their feelings over food and thus deduce what foods they prefer eating and how they're progressing in terms of their relationship with food.

Lastly, there is a links page on the webpage that has a list of resources users can access for help through many different organizations that deal with getting help for people who struggle with eating disorders and other related issues.
